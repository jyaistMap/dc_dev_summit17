# dc_dev_summit17
Scripts from demos during 2017 Esri Developer Summit in Washington D.C.

The scripts in this repository are python scripts used to demonstrate 
various functionality in the ArcGIS Platform. Scripts often would have to be
modified to work on your particular system since they contain information 
pertinent only to the machine used during demonstrations.
